(1) ATTEMPTING TO INSTALL THE COREUTILS PROGRAM AS-IS

I used the command:
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall17/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff

to download the file into the CS35L/lab4 directory, which is where I will be
doing the work for this lab.

I created a new directory called "coreutilstemp" within my CS35L/lab4
directory.

I cd'ed into the coreutils-with-bugs directory.

I used the "./configure" command which ran successfully. I then used:
"make install prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/virgil/CS35L/lab4/coreutilstemp" to try to 
install the file into the coreutilstemp directory.

In doing so, however, I got these errors:

In file included from utimecmp.c:41:0:
utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
 int futimens (int, char const *, struct timespec const [2]);
     ^

                 from utimecmp.c:25:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) PATCHING COREUTILS AND THEN REATTEMPTING TO INSTALL

I used the command:
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall17/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff

which copied the patch into the coreutils-with-bugs directory.

I then used the command:
"patch -p0 < coreutils.diff

which successfully patched the file:
patching file lib/utimens.c
patching file lib/utimens.h
patching file src/copy.c
patching file src/tee.c
patching file src/touch.c

Again, I used the "./configure" and 
"make install prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/virgil/CS35L/lab4/coreutilstemp" commands to 
install coreutils. This time, the program installed successfullly.

Looking at the coreutils.diff file, I noticed these changes:

1) The futimens functions were replaced with coreutils_futimens functions.
2) The tee functions were replaced with coreutils_tee functions.

The error produced when compiling the unpatched program was the result of two
functions with the name futimens, hence the conflicting types error that was
given when attempting to compile.

I infer that the purpose of the changes were to give those futimens functions
different names in order to remove the conflicting types issue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) TESTING COREUTILS IMPLEMENTATION OF LS

If you look in the "coreutilstemp" directory, there is a dirctory called "bin".
Within the "bin" directory is another directory called "ls".

I ran the following commands to create three files. One file has its 
modification date set to the year 1911 while the other files have its 
modification date set to the time it was actually created (i.e. the default). I
created these in a temporary directory:

tmp=$(mktemp -d)
cd $tmp
touch -d '1911-01-03 01:00 GMT' world-war-1
touch now
sleep 1
touch now1

I then ran this command to check the modification dates of the three files I
just created:
TZ=UTC0 ~/CS35L/lab4/coreutilstemp/bin/ls -lt --full-time world-war-1 now now1

-rw-r--r-- 1 virgil csugrad 0 1911-01-02 17:00:00.000000000 -0800 world-war-1
-rw-r--r-- 1 virgil csugrad 0 2017-10-27 14:19:53.603972829 -0700 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 virgil csugrad 0 2017-10-27 14:19:50.261917388 -0700 now

It is clear from these results that a bug (or bugs) is/are present in the
coreutils implemetnation of ls. The file world-war-1 is listed first despite
being the "oldest" file, when it should be the last file listed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) REPRODUCING THE PROBLEM USING GDB

In the temp directory, I ran the command:
"gdb ~/CS35L/lab4/coreutilstemp/bin/ls"

In gdb, I then ran the command:
(gdb) "info functions"

This gave a list of functions that the ls program uses. If you look at all the
functions on the list, you will discover a function called
"static int compare_mtime(V, V)"

The coreutils implementation of ls did not display the files in order of their
modification date correctly, and it can be inferred that this function may have
to do with this.

I set a breakpoint at the compare_mtime function:
(gdb) "break compare_mtime"

I then ran the program with the following options:
(gdb) "r -lt --full-time world-war-1 now now1"


Stepping in leads us to this line, line 48 in timespec_cmp:
"int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;"

This line may be the cause of the issue. When a.tv_sec is very small, then it
will underflow and wrap around. This would in turn cause diff to overflow, and
thus this comparison function can possibly give us the wrong result.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) FIXING THE PROBLEM

I cp'd timespec.h into my lab4 directory. I created a copy of that file called
newtimespec.h. In that file, I modified lines 48 and 49 so that they no longer
compare using subtraction.

I used the command:
"diff timespec.h newtimespec.h > lab4.diff"

to create a diff file which I use to patch the coreutils-with-bugs file.

I went to the coreutils-with-bugs/lib directory and applied the patch using
the command:
"patch -p0 timespec.h < ~/CS35L/lab4/lab4.diff"

I then reconfigured and reinstalled and then tested to make sure the patch
worked (i.e. "./configure" and "make install 
prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/virgil/CS35L/lab4/coreutilstemp").

... and we get the results that we've been looking for!

touch -d '1910-02-21 01:03 GMT' world-war-3-in-a-parallel-universe
touch now
sleep 1
touch now1

TZ=UTC0 ~/CS35L/lab4/coreutilstemp/bin/ls -lt --full-time world-war-3-in-a-parallel-universe now now1

-rw-r--r-- 1 virgil csugrad 0 2017-10-31 06:06:42.649808901 +0000 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 virgil csugrad 0 2017-10-31 06:06:36.332703865 +0000 now
