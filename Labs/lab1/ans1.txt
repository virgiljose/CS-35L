Note: // indicates a comment.

1. COMMAND(S):
   apropos [phrase]

2. COMMAND(S):
   which cp
   which wc

   RESULTS:
   cp is located at /usr/bin/cp
   wc is located at /usr/bin/wc

3. COMMAND(S):
   find /usr/bin -name "?" 
   // ? is used as a "wildcard" for any character. In this case, we use it 
   // to indicate that we want to find any executable that is one 
   // character long
   man [
   man w
   man X (we discover that X is not an executable itself but rather a 
   symbolic link because no page for X exist)
   readlink -f X (we discover that the executable that X links to is Xorg)

   RESULTS: (we can use the man pages to figure out what each of them do):
   [ - Used to evaluate a conditional expression.
   w - Shows who is logged on and what they are doing.
   X - Not an executable itself, but a symbolic link to the command X.org, 
   which runs a server.

4. COMMAND(S):
   readlink -f 'emacs'

   RESULTS:
   The command actually executed is /usr/bin/emacs-24.3

5. COMMAND(S):
   man chmod

   RESULTS:
   g+s - set group ID on execution.
   o-x - other users may not execute the program (or search for directories)
   i.e. we are taking away their permission.


6. COMMAND(S):
   find . -type d -mtime -21
   // the option is -mtime   

7. RESULTS (follow-up to #6):
   ./.cache/abrt
   ./.emacs.d/auto-save-list
   ./.ccache/f
   ./CS35L
   ./junk
   ./CS35Lbackup

8. COMMAND(S):
   which find
   // find is located at /usr/bin, so I will change the current directory
   to that location.
   cd /usr/bin
   find -type l

   RESULTS (it's 261 - did I really have to count all that?):

9. COMMAND(S):
   ls -lt --group-directories-first

   RESULTS:
   -rwxr-xr-x   1 root root   18692 Jan 26  2014 libgpg-error.so.0.10.0

10. COMMAND(S):
    man locale

    RESULTS:
    In the man page, we come across this entry:
    
    FILES:	
    /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
              Usual default locale archive location.

    /usr/share/i18n/locales
              Usual default path for locale definition files.	

11. COMMAND(S):
    emacs
    // the commands below are run in emacs:
    C-h
    a sort

    RESULTS:
    sort-pages
    sort-paragraphs
    tabulated-list-col-sort
    tabulated-list-sort

    // Some people get more results for some reason. I ran emacs on lnxsrv09. 
    // Perhaps different versions of emacs produce varying results.

12. COMMAND(S):
    C-h
    k C-M-a
    k C-M-b
    k C-M-c
    k C-M-d
    k C-M-e
    k C-M-f
    k C-M-g
    k C-M-h

    RESULTS:
    C-M-a moves cursor to the beginning of the current or next function 
    	  (i.e. at the function's header). (beginning-of-defun).
    C-M-b moves backward across one balanced expression. Assumes point is 
    	  not in a string or comment. (backward-sexp).
    C-M-c exits from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer 
    	  (exit-recursive-edit).
    C-M-d moves forward down one level of parentheses. (down-list).
    C-M-e moves cursor to the end of the current function (i.e. at its 
    	  closing brace). (end-of-defun).
    C-M-f moves forward across one balanced expression. (sexp).
    C-M-g does not exist (but C-g does; read #13).
    C-M-h puts region around whole current or following function. (mark-defun).

    These commands are all useful in the context of writing programs, 
    as they are used for navigating around expressions and functions.

13. COMMAND(S):
    C-h
    k C-g

    RESULTS:
    According to the emacs, the key signals a quit condition. During execution 
    of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly. At
    top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

14. COMMAND(S):
    C-h
    f yank

    RESULTS:
    Pastes (reinserts) the most recently killed text. It's pretty 
    much pasting...

15. COMMAND(S):
    ls -l

    emacs
    M-x dired
    /usr/bin

    RESULTS:
    
    ls -l lists 350752 bytes (?) used. It does NOT list the . and 
    .. directories.

    dired lists 350840 bytes used, as well as 11623156 bytes 
    available. It also lists the . and .. directories.
