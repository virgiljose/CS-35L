1. Notice how these two lines look very similar, but have different functions:

case long_iso_time_style:     is a switch statement.
case_long_iso_time_style:     is a goto label.

It was not functionally necessary to remove the goto label. The purpose of 
removing the label was simply to clean up the code.

If the goto label were not removed, then the switch statement would've fallen
to the goto label anyway and the code would have proceeded as normal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The patch adds this line of code at the end:

long_time_format[i] = dcgettext(NULL, long_time_format[i], LC_TIME);

The function dcgettext in the context of this program translates the array
long_time_format according to whatever locale is given in the function call of
dcgettext.

If no translation is found, then long_time_format will retain its same value;
i.e. it will retain the traditional UNIX format, in English. This could be a 
problem for users who use different locales and thus use different time formats.

3. Running the command "python randline.py /dev/null" results in this:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is 
    empty
IndexError: list index out of range

According to the comments in the script, it "Outputs lines selected randomly
from a file" (hence the name of the script, randline, i.e. random line). The
script returns an error if there are no lines in the input file, i.e. if the
file is empty, as the seq array basically puts each line in array.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Running the command "python3 randline.py /dev/null" results in this:

File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This error was not present when running in python2 (it did not catch an error
until line 274). The cause of this error was that IOError is now a part of
OSError, which only takes one argument as opposed to a tuple. The syntax
error came from the fact that the code used two arguments rather than one
as specified by python3.
